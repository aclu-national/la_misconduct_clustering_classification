# Clustering and Classifying Misconduct Allegations in Louisiana

## Clustering

The clustering code uses TF-IDF, all-MiniLM-L6-v2, and DistilBERT base model (uncased) embeddings, Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) dimensionality reduction, and Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HBSCAN) clustering. Please see the code for specific parameters.
